Internal Order,can be marked as posted to as a,Statistical Internal Order
Statistical Internal Order,then you can assign cost to the order in addition to the posting on a real,CO Object
Statistical Internal Order,advantage that you can analyze the cost on the order and on the cost center at once for the,Cost Center
Statistical Internal Order, advantage that you don’t have to settle the order later, which would consume time and would result in an addition ,FI Document
Statistical Internal Order, and you cannot settle the order later, which would consume time and would result in an additional ,FI Document

Settlement Rule,must be defined for each,Internal Order
Settlement Rule,is defined in the record of the order's,Internal Order Master Data
Settlement Rule,may specify that all of the costs on the order are settled to a single or may be split to multiple,Receiver
Internal Order Settlement,can be structured flexibly by using one of the many available settlement options by using a,Settlement Rule
